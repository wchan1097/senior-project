# SeniorProject


 ## Motivation
 As our senior project, we were interested in making a web-based application to solve the problem of employers' injured employees not making their medical appointments on time. Pateints not showing up for their scheduled appointments costs billions of dollars annually for the healthcare system and also for the employers.The idea was to build an application that helps in eliminating or reducing that huge annual lost of money.
 ## Solution
 The proposed,implemented, solution was building an application named 'Health Care Transportation Schedulig App' which runs on a computer system. All scheduling is managed by a third party enity. It is some sort of a ride-sharing application but not like the common ones in which it is the patients who themselves manage their schedules/appointments.The application provides the customer service representatives of the third party entity with necessary tools to make suituable schedules for their custmoers. And enables them to take necessary measures so that a patients do not lose their medical appointments under any circumstances.
